# Introducing p5js and Objects

As you work on this assignment, you should also refer to the [notes in our textbook](https://graded-cs-resources.github.io/IB-Computer-Science-Notes/unit2/01_Programming_with_objects.html).

## Getting your code

Use Github Desktop as usual to download this assignment and open in Visual Studio Code.

The code that is actually *ours* is found inside the `app` subdirectory. Make sure that directory is expanded. The files we will be looking at are `sketch.ts` and `modules\ball.ts`. All of the other files are imported from other sources to make the p5js library work.

## Setting up

Before the code will work, you need to run `npm install` for the project. You can do this using the integrated command line in VS Code OR you can use the `Terminal->Run Task` menu and find the `npm: install` task.

You may need to restart VS code after running `npm install` - try this if you have issues.

## Running the code

You have two options. 
1. Put typescript in watch mode (ctrl-shift-b, choose `tsc watch`) and then press the `Go Live` button
2. Use the `Build and Serve` task to do both of these in one click. It actually uses a different server, not the `Go Live` button.

Either way, you should ALSO be able to then press F5 to open a special instance of Chrome that opens to the right page and gives you magic debugging power.

## Using and completing the code.

- [ ] Open the `index.ts` in the `src` folder and read the code. There are a few questions and tasks there, including instructions on how to act
- [ ] After completing the tasks in `sketch.ts` open the `modules/ball.ts` file and read THAT code. There are some additional questions and tasks there. you may need to switch back to `sketch.ts` as instructed.
